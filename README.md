# Debug Project for Hubspot ChatBot CodeSnippets

Since a colleague of mine has to do some Hubspot code snippets I thought it would be a nice idea to help him with a proper debug project.
Maybe this can help you as well.

Features:
- Chat Messages and Responses
- Custom State
- Secrets

This debugger is pretty limited following restrictions apply:
- No QuickAnswer Options
- The Event object is only updated in a very limited fashion. Most fields are not touched at all.

Requirements :
- NodeJs (Ideally the version Hubspot uses. I think It was 14.02)

Install :
- git clone
- npm init
- run with Visual Studio Code
